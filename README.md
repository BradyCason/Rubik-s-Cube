To use the Rubik's Cube, run the rubiks_cube_simulation file. It will use the rubiks_cube_finctions 
file to make moves.

The rubiks_cube_solution_finder file is not complete. I was going to make it find a 
solution using the beginner method, but I never finished it.

Be careful using the rubiks_cube_solver file. It was intended to find the optimal solution, but it
just bruteforces the simulation and never finishes unless the solution is very short.
